# Efficient Edge-Preserving Image Deblurring with Non-Convex TV-l_p Regularization and Chebyshev-Accelerated ADMM

## Detailed Analysis and Results

The following provides a comprehensive analysis of each image and blur kernel for the proposed model, alongside comparisons with existing models. The analysis is divided into three key attachments:

1. **Quantitative Assessment.xlsx**  
   This file presents a detailed comparison of deblurring results, including PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM metrics, across various p-values and blur kernels.

2. **Edge Recovery and Distortion Analysis.xlsx**  
   This file contains a thorough evaluation of Edge Distortion Ratio (EDR) and Modified Hamming Distance (MHD) metrics for different test images and blur kernels.

3. **Quantitative Benchmarking.xlsx**  
   This file compares the performance of the proposed model against state-of-the-art models using PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM metrics across a range of test images and blur kernels.
